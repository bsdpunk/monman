Summon Duplicate (minor, not while bloodied; at-will)  Conjuration , Psychic The berbalang manifests an exact duplicate of itself in an unoccupied adjacent square. It can have no more than four duplicates at once, and duplicates cannot summon other duplicates. When a duplicate appears, it makes an initiative check and joins the battle on that initiative count. All damage a duplicate deals is treated as psychic damage. A duplicate has the same statistics as the berbalang except for its hit points. When the berbalang manifests a duplicate, the berbalang loses one-quarter of its current hit points and the duplicate appears with that quantity of hit points. The berbalang's maximum number of hit points remains the same. Duplicates last until the berbalang reaches 0 hit points, absorbs them, or uses sacrifice. A duplicate must stay within 10 squares of the berbalang at all times or it disappears. Absorb Duplicate (standard, at-will)  Healing The berbalang absorbs a duplicate adjacent to it and regains 50 hit points. Berbalang Sneak Attack A berbalang or a duplicate that flanks an enemy with another duplicate deals an extra 1d8 damage on melee attacks against that enemy.
